# Context-Aware Deep Linking - Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Multi-Intent Detection System**
Extended `src/services/intentDetector.ts` to detect 6 types of intents:

- **Ride Booking** (Uber only)
  - Keywords: uber, ride, taxi, cab, drive, pickup
  - Extracts: start location, destination
  - Example: "book an uber from Amazon Santa Monica to LAX airport"

- **Restaurants**
  - Keywords: restaurant, food, eat, dining, pizza, burger, etc.
  - Extracts: cuisine type, location
  - Example: "find pizza restaurants near LAX"

- **Places/Attractions**
  - Keywords: stadium, venue, arena, place, attraction
  - Extracts: place name
  - Example: "show me SoFi Stadium"

- **Translation**
  - Keywords: translate, how do I say, speak
  - Extracts: text to translate, target language
  - Example: "translate hello to spanish"

- **Tickets**
  - Keywords: ticket, buy ticket, purchase
  - Action: Opens FIFA official tickets page
  - Example: "buy tickets for the match"

- **Navigation**
  - Keywords: navigate, directions, route, how do I get
  - Extracts: destination
  - Example: "navigate to LAX"

### 2. **Chat Interface Integration**
Updated `src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`:
- Calls `detectIntent()` before sending each message
- Routes to appropriate DeepLinkService methods based on intent type
- Passes extracted context (addresses, search terms, text, etc.)
- Still sends message to AI for response
- Non-blocking: deep link opens while chat continues

### 3. **Simplified Ride Booking**
Updated `src/services/deepLinkService.ts`:
- Removed all Lyft fallback logic
- Uses Uber only for all ride bookings
- Simplified `openRideBooking()` and `openRideBookingFromAddresses()`

### 4. **Dashboard Quick Actions**
Updated `src/components/QuickActions/QuickActions.tsx`:
- Changed subtitle from "Uber/Lyft" to "Uber" only
- Verified all handlers are wired up correctly
- Click handlers already working (were implemented previously)

```

## üîß Technical Details

### Intent Detection Flow
1. User sends message in chat
2. `detectIntent(text)` runs first
3. Returns `{ type, data }` with intent type and extracted context
4. ChatInterface routes to appropriate DeepLinkService method
5. Deep link opens in new tab (desktop) or app (mobile)
6. Message continues to AI backend for response

### Context Extraction
- **Addresses:** Extracted from "from X to Y" patterns
- **Search Terms:** Cuisine types, food keywords
- **Place Names:** Capitalized words, stadium names
- **Text:** Quoted text or text after "translate"
- **Languages:** Spanish, French, English, etc.

### Venue Matching
- Chat searches all FIFA 2026 venues
- Matches by city name or venue name
- Falls back to default venue (first in list)
- Used for Yelp, Navigation, Translation context

## üéØ Current Behavior

‚úÖ **Working:**
- All 6 intent types detect correctly
- Context extraction from natural language
- Deep links open with extracted data
- Chat continues normally after redirect
- Dashboard Quick Actions trigger deep links
- Uber-only (no Lyft fallback)

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add confirmation dialog** before opening links
2. **Show toast notification** when intent is detected
3. **Add venue selector** in chat UI
4. **Geocoding integration** for precise address lookup
5. **Intent history** to track opened links
6. **Analytics** to measure intent detection accuracy

## üìä Files Modified

1. `src/services/intentDetector.ts` - Added multi-intent detection
2. `src/components/ChatInterface.tsx` - Wired all intents
3. `src/services/deepLinkService.ts` - Simplified to Uber only
4. `src/components/QuickActions/QuickActions.tsx` - Updated subtitle
5. `scripts/test-ride-intent-plain.js` - Test script for validation

## üîç Debug Console

Open browser DevTools Console to see:
- `Detected intent:` logs showing what was detected
- Intent type and extracted data
- Any errors in detection or redirect

## ‚ú® User Experience

When a user types a message with actionable intent:
1. Deep link opens immediately (non-blocking)
2. AI still processes and responds to the message
3. User gets both: the action AND the conversation
4. Seamless, context-aware experience
